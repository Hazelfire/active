# Rough draft

Motivation:

What is the problem space?
What is the algebraic structure through examples.

This is not real-time interactive rendering. These animations take time to
render, and it's not the focus.

We don't want to do mapping on time.

horizontal composition, sequencing, and overlap on endpoints with an arbitrary
semigroup.
two kinds of parallel composition. neither is more fundamental.


One is the applicative instance, which motivates why we want to do infinite
things.

Pure creates infinite things. Clock example is a good practical motivation.

This is good but we have terrible quadratic performance.
Now we switch to using a deep embedding.
How to do linear time sampling using affine rays.
The glue monoid.

QR code idea ought to go in.


## NOT in the paper:
* Monoidal annotations. Pause points, page numbers, named anchor points.
The story isn't quite finished here, becuase there needs to be something
affine. A semiring and an action? There's a story there, but that's another
paper.

* Randomness


# Related work

* Work by Pieter and Tom
* Reanimate library. Only for animations, not polymorphic. Has an incredible
  number of integrations with blender and many other animations frameworks.
